<blockquote>The centralized permission based authorization</blockquote>
</p>

Blitz Guard is an authorization library which allows or restricts access to specific resources.
It implements [Attribute-based access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control)

It aims to reduce boilerplate and hard to understand authorization rules by having only a single source of truth in the [Ability file](ability-file)
